# newsletter_signup
In this repo, I have used one another API , mailchimp, which stores the data collected by the form from client side. I used express on the server side along with packages such as https, body-parser (for json parsing) .With proper authentication mechanism as explained in mailchimp documentation , any user can get subscribed to my newsletter by just filling and submitting the form. This also I deployed on Heroku (link:  https://gentle-refuge-48134.herokuapp.com  )
